# Vision

The Agentic Agile Coach is a self-learning, multi-agent system that transforms sprint planning and
backlog refinement into a data-informed, conversational experience. It continuously learns from
delivery outcomes and user feedback to evolve its understanding of quality, risk, and
readiness‚Äîtailoring its guidance to the specific needs of each team and product over time.

## üß† Why Self-Learning Matters

Most Agile tools are static checklists or frameworks. This system grows smarter with use:

- Learns which types of stories lead to delivery issues.
- Adapts criteria scoring based on historical outcomes.
- Refines its sprint readiness model by analyzing actual sprint performance.
- Learns communication patterns that drive better user engagement and faster resolution of ambiguities.

## üîÅ Learning Feedback Loops

- **Post-sprint analysis**: Evaluates story quality vs delivery success.
- **User feedback**: Accepts ratings or corrections to improve future assessments.
- **Outcome correlation**: Adjusts weighting of criteria based on what actually impacts delivery.
- **Roadmap refinement**: Adapts to shifting priorities and business context without reprogramming.

This turns the Agile Coach into a true organizational memory‚Äîa system that not only supports your
team today, but helps it become measurably better tomorrow.

## Strategic Purpose

Modern Agile teams are overwhelmed‚Äînot by a lack of tools, but by the cognitive load of
decision-making, prioritization, and alignment. Stories are written in a rush, sprints are filled
with unclear scope, and teams often miss critical dependencies until it's too late.

The Agentic Agile Coach attempts to solve this by acting as a proactive partner, not a passive
dashboard.

## What It Does

- Evaluates user stories against proven quality criteria with expert precision‚Äîassigning scores and
  suggesting improvements.
- Audits sprint backlogs to determine sprint readiness, surfacing risks, sequencing issues, and
  misalignments with goals, OKRs, and velocity.
- Guides through conversation‚Äîclarifies vague requirements, flags blockers, and recommends
  additions or removals from the backlog.
- Draws from context (via Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to reason about roadmap alignment,
  historical data, technical dependencies, and product goals.

## The Future It Enables

- **Fewer planning surprises**: No more unready stories or "we missed that" moments mid-sprint.
- **Higher delivery confidence**: Teams commit to realistic, high-impact work.
- **Stronger product alignment**: Sprint execution becomes a reflection of strategic intent.
- **Autonomous refinement**: The system becomes a collaborative team member‚Äîsuggesting, updating,
  and shaping the backlog without micromanagement.

## Core Principles

- **Agentic by design**: Each specialized agent does one thing well, coordinated by a reasoning
  graph.
- **Conversational UX**: Natural language drives interaction and refinement.
- **Explainable decisions**: No black box scoring‚Äîevery assessment is accompanied by rationale
  and improvement advice.
- **Context-aware**: Powered by RAG, and continuously learning from past performance, the system
  never works in isolation‚Äîit knows your product, your team, and your priorities.
